# EDITING

Editing provides a wonderful opportunity for writers and communicators to sharpen their language and elevate the impact of their work. As an editor, I am passionate about my job and hold myself to high standards of accuracy, honesty, and fairness. 

Before we begin working together, I will ask for a sample of the text that you would like to have revised. After establishing what you would like the end-product to be, I will revise the text the first time, leaving comments in places where clarification is needed. You will have the option to accept the revisions or not, and address comments and amend the text where you see fit. I will then revise your revisions, and so the cycle continues until you and I feel that the text is ready for publication. I charge 35 euros per hour, which is among the most competitive rates on the market.
