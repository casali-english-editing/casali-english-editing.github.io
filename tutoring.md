# ENGLISH LESSONS

After an intake session in which we figure out your goals and areas for improvement, it is recommended that you come for weekly hour-long lessons. I offer these lessons in my home, near the Groningen train station. We can work on language systems and skills, using Cambridge classroom methods. I will provide all of the materials, you don't need to buy any books. 

The cost of each hour-long session is 25 euros, which is an extremely competitive rate. Discounts are given for referrals and the purchase of class bundles. Enquire for the possibility of group rates.

> You speak English beautifully, which means you can't be English.

Together we will focus on your areas for improvement
with the use of modern Cambridge teaching techniques.
